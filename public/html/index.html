          <!-- <p id="openingStory">You and a group of friends have gone skiing in the backcountry. It is cold but the sun is shining and there is fresh powder. As you are posing for a picture mid mountain, the ground begins to shake and the entire group is swept away by an avalanche. Unfortunately, you are the only survivor. You need to walk to the nearest town, which is 10 miles away. All of the supplies have been scattered, however, you find a backpack which has room for four items. Choose carefully because there are many obstacles that might block your path and your items could prove useful. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor!</p>

          <p id="bearStory">Oh no! You have encountered a bear and he is angry! If you have an axe in your backpack, you will be able to effectively fend off the bear and continue on your way. If not, you lose 20 life points as a result of your effort to get away from him.</p> 

          <p id="riverStory">Whoa! There is a rather large river crossing your path. It is much too far to go around so you must go through it. You will get wet, however, if you have a flint in your backpack you will be able to make a fire and get back on your way quickly. If not, you will be miserable and lose 5 life points because now you are cold and wet.</p>

          <p id="cravasseStory">Holy split in the mountain! You have come upon a very deep and menacing cravasse! What will you do? If you are lucky enough to have climbing gear in your backpack, you should be able to maneuver across it. If not, you lose an hour finding a safer path.</p>

          <p id="brokenboneStory">Bad luck! You have fallen and broken your leg! That's going to make walking a little difficult. If you have a first aid kit in your backpack, you will be able to splint your leg and hit the road again. If not, your speed will drop by 25% and that town is starting to seem a lot farther away.</p>

          <p id="frostbiteStory">The cold has finally caught up to you and your hands are now numb. You have frostbite! If you have hand warmers in your backpack, you can warm your hands and you are good to go. If not, you lose 10 life points because that frostbite is only to get worse.</p>

          <p id="wolfStory">Gadzooks! There is a wolf in your way and he looks hungry! If you have any food in your backback, you can throw it at him and continue on your way without so much as a scratch. If not, you lose an hour running away from him.

          <p id="bizzardStory">The weather has taken a turn for the worse. The sun is no longer shining and a blizzard has blown in! If you have an emergency blanket in your backpack, you will be able to throw it over yourself and forge ahead. If not, that snow is going to seriously hinder your progress and your speed will drop by 75%.</p>

          <p id="darknessStory">Yikes! Darkness is closing in and you are no longer able to see where you are going. If you have a flashlight in your backpack, you will continue to make headway. If not, your speed will drop by 25% as you feel your way through the trees.
